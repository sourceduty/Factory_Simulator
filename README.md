[Factory Simulator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-tYRlt7b2g-factory-simulator) is designed to assist in organizing and planning the structure of industrial factories. It helps users create and optimize factory layouts and understand the intricacies of production and assembly processes through text-based diagrams. The tool offers guidance on arranging factory components efficiently, analyzing and improving existing layouts, and translating complex industrial processes into structured, easy-to-understand diagrams. This supports better visualization, decision-making, and process improvement in factory settings.

### Example Usage

Below is an example of a simple production line for assembling a small electronic device, such as a smartphone. This diagram will illustrate the flow from receiving raw materials to the final packaging stage using plain text symbols and structure.

1. Raw Material Storage: This is the starting point where all necessary components and raw materials are stored. Using a First In, First Out (FIFO) system ensures that older stock is used first to prevent material aging.

2. Component Preparation: Components are prepared for assembly. This includes SMD (Surface-Mount Device) placements, soldering on printed circuit boards (PCBs), and initial testing to ensure functionality before assembly.

3. Assembly Station: Components and electronics are assembled together, either manually or with automated machinery. Software might be integrated during or after this stage.

4. Quality Control: After assembly, each unit undergoes thorough visual and functional testing to ensure that it meets the required specifications and quality standards.

5. Packaging and Shipping: Finally, the products are packaged, labeled, and prepared for distribution. Packaging also includes safety checks to ensure products are securely packed to avoid damage during transport.

This layout aims to provide a clear, streamlined workflow for the production of electronic devices, optimizing each stage for efficiency and quality control.
